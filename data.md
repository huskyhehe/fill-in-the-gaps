## Why a company's application use salesforce, postgreSQL and Amazon S3 at the same time? What's the connection between these three data tools?

A company may use Salesforce, PostgreSQL, and Amazon S3 at the same time for a variety of reasons. Here are a few possible explanations:

-   **Salesforce** is a customer relationship management (CRM) system that is often used to manage customer data, such as contact information, sales history, and support tickets. It includes a wide range of features for sales, marketing, and customer service, as well as integration with other tools and services.

-   **PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source relational database management system that is often used to store and manage large amounts of structured data. It can be used to store data that is not suitable for Salesforce, such as complex data, large amounts of data or a specific need like data warehousing, analytics and reporting.

-   **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is a cloud-based storage service that is often used to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, and documents. It can be integrated with other services, like Salesforce and PostgreSQL, to provide scalable, secure, and cost-effective storage.

It is likely that the company is using Salesforce to manage customer data and relationships, PostgreSQL to store and manage large amounts of structured data, and Amazon S3 to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data. Salesforce and PostgreSQL can be integrated to share data between the systems, this way the company can have all the data needed in one place and make sure it is consistent and updated. Additionally, using Amazon S3 allows the company to store and manage large amounts of data at a lower cost than traditional storage solutions.
