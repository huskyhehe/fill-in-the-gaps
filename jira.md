-   **[Epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics)** are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).

**Examples**
- Initiative
    - Let's say your rocket ship company wants to **decrease the cost per launch by 5% this year** 
    - That's a great fit for an initiative, as no single epic could likely achieve that big of a goal
    - Within that initiative, there would be epics such as:
- Epic
    - Decrease launch-phase fuel consumption by 1%
    - Increase launches per quarter from 3 to 4
    - Turn all thermostats down from 71 to 69 degrees
- Story
    - User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as *persona + need + purpose*
    - **"As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].**
