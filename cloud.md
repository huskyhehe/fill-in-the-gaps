## What's the difference between VMware private cloud and AWS private cloud?

VMware private cloud and AWS private cloud are both private cloud computing solutions, but they differ in several key ways:

-   **Infrastructure:** VMware private cloud is a software-defined data center (SDDC) solution that allows a company to build and manage their own private cloud infrastructure using VMware's virtualization technology. This infrastructure can be hosted on-premises or in a colocation facility. AWS private cloud, on the other hand, is a cloud-based infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solution that is hosted and managed by Amazon Web Services.

-   **Control:** With VMware private cloud, a company has more control over their infrastructure, as they are responsible for managing and maintaining the underlying hardware, software, and network components. With AWS private cloud, the company has less control over the infrastructure, as it is managed by AWS.

-   **Flexibility:** VMware private cloud is more flexible than AWS private cloud in terms of the types of workloads that can be run, as it supports a wide range of operating systems, applications, and devices. AWS private cloud is more limited in this regard, as it is primarily designed to run AWS-specific services and applications.

-   **Cost:** VMware private cloud is generally considered to be more expensive than AWS private cloud, as it requires a significant investment in hardware, software, and personnel. AWS private cloud is generally considered to be more cost-effective, as it is a pay-as-you-go service and does not require a significant up-front investment.

-   **Scale:** AWS private cloud provides more scalability than VMware private cloud, as it is built on the public cloud infrastructure, which is built to scale to meet the demands of a large number of customers.

In summary, VMware private cloud is a software-defined data center solution that allows a company to build and manage their own private cloud infrastructure using VMware's virtualization technology, while AWS private cloud is a cloud-based infrastructure-as-a-service solution that is hosted and managed by Amazon Web Services. Both have their own set of advantages and disadvantages, it depends on the company needs, the use case and the budget.
